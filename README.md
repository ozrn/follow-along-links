# JS30 #22: follow-along-links
This is a simple project where follow-along navbar and links are built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
## Overview
In this project, all of the links are highlighted by sizing to their actual widths and heights as they are hovered on.<br><br>
A method called getBoundingClientRect() is called to get all the link elements' position on the page and it returns a DOMRect object for each hovered link with eight properties: left, top, right, bottom, x, y, width, height.<br><br>
*Make sure that window.ScrollY and window.ScrollX values added to the top and left coordinates values to make transition accurately when scrolling down*.
